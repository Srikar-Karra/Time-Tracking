# Time-Tracking
It is app which tracks the applications that you are using. If you are using google chrome it will get the tab that you are using. This data is sent to a json file which can be used for detremining whether you are "productive". 
I plan to add a readdata.py which can make a timeline of the appilications that you were using and give you statistics.
It's a simple python script and can only be used on mac os since the code uses apple script.
